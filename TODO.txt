For weapons:
-search by:
-skill
-name
-sharpness
-attack
:all are fields that require the inputted filters when written

rather than searching all terms at once, sequentially search to redult possible runtime


-in weapon dropdown, users can either enter specific weapons, or queue properties about it:
take string from input and send to backend to remove commas and query each item indivudally
returns a selection of all found weapons and their statistics, once clicked, is added to build in slot1, replacing prior

---------
for weapon autofill:
    on csvUpdate




---------
for build manager + skill display, after each equipment addition and removal, recalculate each skill total
ex: someone adds Jin Dahaad boots for agitator, raises skill to lvl 5 but effectively has 6
    UI would display Agitator: [Level 6/5]: Over cap

    Build a dictionary to compile build information
For each skill in  specificWeapon.skills, 



autofill monsters and weapon names in weapon or monster name section


read in all weapon skills
read in all monster names/ weapon names per weapon


total amount of required materials


how to handle multiple areas of input




----------  
THE FUCKING THING WORKS
at a base level:
    get weapon name, attack, affinity, element/ailment



NEXT UP, display item card with info on mouseover
THEN, be able to add/ remove from center

when clicked or enter is pressed, weapon selection goes to slot1
while any piece of equipment is in a slot, click to remove it



----------------------
make the fucking tooltip transfer to the 

statements in the placeholder tooltip to add phial type, shelling type/ lvl and ammo?

how does ammo work here - just a list of all ammo?


middle tooltip viewer only changes when scrolling through, must add for each search method
